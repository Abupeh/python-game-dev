# Problem Set 0: Scratch Cat

## Setup

For this problem set, you'll use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). To save and share your work, be sure to create an account if you don't already have one. (You can save your work locally on the computer, but I can't promise it'll be there the next time you look.)

## How to submit

Show me your solutions to:

- `Hello <name>`
- `Reated Flips`
- `Challenge!`

## What To Build

Keep a blank canvas and use the default cat sprite (we'll call him Scratch Cat). You'll have a chance to show off your creativity in the first project.

### Hello World

Make Scratch Cat say "Hello World!" in a speech bubble when the green flag is clicked.

### Hello <name>

Make Scratch Cat ask the user for his name when the green flag is clicked. When the user enters his name, Scratch Cat should say hello to him. **Make sure that Scratch Cat uses the name input by the user.**

### Tickle

Make Scratch Cat say "That tickles!" in a speech bubble if you touch him with the mouse pointer.

### Flip

Make Scratch Cat do a flip (rotate 360°).

If you're stuck, think about how animation works. Maybe Scratch Cat needs to rotate a little bit at a time rather than 360° all at once.

### Repeated Flips

Make Scratch Cat flip 3 (or 4 or 5) times.

Bonus: Ask the user for a number between 1 and 5 and have Scratch flip that many times.

Double Bonus: Make Scratch Cat count his flips. For example, after his second flip, make him say in a speech bubble "2" and after his third flip, make him say "3".

Look again: Did you need to repeat the same code blocks multiple times to get Scratch Cat to do multiple flips? Experiment with the blocks in the "Control" section to find a way to repeat an action without repeating code.

### Challenge!

Make your own code block called `flip` and use it. This [documentation](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/My_Blocks) may help.

Bonus: Let your `flip` block take as an input the number of times Scratch Cat should flip.
