# Problem Set 0: Scratch Cat

## Setup

For this problem set, you'll use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). To save and share your work, create an account if you don't already have one. (You can save your work locally on the computer, but I can't promise it'll be there the next time you look.)

## How to submit

Show me your solutions to:

- `Hello <name>`
- `Reated Flips`
- `Challenge!`

## What To Build

Let's not worry about the looks of the project for now. Leave the canvas blank and use the default cat sprite (we'll call him Scratch Cat). You'll have a chance to show off your creativity in the first project.

**Start by dragging the "when green flag clicked" block from the "Events" section to the code area. This block will run the code inside it when the green flag is clicked.**

### Hello World

Make Scratch Cat say "Hello World!" (in a speech bubble) when the green flag is clicked.

### Hello <name>

Make Scratch Cat ask the user for his name when the green flag is clicked. When the user enters his name, Scratch Cat should say hello to him. **Make sure that Scratch Cat uses the name supplied by the user.** For example, if the user says his name is John, Scratch Cat should say "Hello John!". If the user says his name is Dansby Swanson, Scratch Cat should say "Hello Dansby Swanson!".

### Tickle

Make Scratch Cat say "That tickles!" (in a speech bubble) if you touch him with the mouse pointer.

### Flip

Make Scratch Cat do a flip (rotate 360°).

If you're stuck, think about how animation works. Maybe Scratch Cat needs to rotate a little bit at a time rather than 360° all at once.

### Repeated Flips

Make Scratch Cat flip 3 (or 4 or 5) times.

Look again: Did you need to repeat the same code blocks multiple times to get Scratch Cat to do multiple flips? Experiment with the blocks in the "Control" section to find a way to repeat an action without repeating code.

Bonus: ask the user for a number between 1 and 5 and have Scratch flip that many times.

Double Bonus: make Scratch Cat count his flips. For example, after his second flip, make him say (in a speech bubble) "2" and after his third flip, make him say "3".

### Challenge!

Make your own code block called `flip` and use it. This [documentation](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/My_Blocks) may help.

Bonus: Let your `flip` block take as an input the number of times Scratch Cat should flip.
