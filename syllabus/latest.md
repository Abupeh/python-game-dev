## Virtues

**Hard work.** Like most things worth doing, learning to code isn't easy. But I promise: show up, put in the work, and you'll be amazed at what you can do.

**Craftsmanship.** Anything worth doing is worth doing well. It's okay to start with hacky or janky code, but let's keep honing our craft, too.

**Adventerousness & daring-do.** Its difficulty is no small part of what makes coding enjoyable.
