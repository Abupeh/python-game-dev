Period 6

## Course Description

Students in this project-based course will learn fundamental computer science concepts and computer programming by completing coding challenges and building text-based and 2D games in Python. The course is designed to be approachable and challenging for complete beginners and experienced coders alike.

## Virtues

**Hard work.** Like most things worth doing, learning to code isn't easy. That's no small part of what makes it enjoyable. You'll sweat a little, but you'll be stronger for it. Embrace the challenge.

**Craftsmanship.** Anything worth doing is worth doing well. It's okay to start with hacky or janky code, but let's keep honing our craft, too.

**Adventerousness & daring-do.** Experiment. Tinker. Try new things. Take a few risks. It's the best way to learn and you (probably) won't blow anything up.

**Perseverence.** Code rarely works the first time. Problems can seem intractable. Keep trying. Keep learning. Keep going. You'll get there.

**Resourcefulness.** You will (often) hit walls. Get good at scaling them. Solutions and help are out there if you learn how to ask and where to look.

**Generosity.** We're in this together. Encourage each other and help however you can. The more freely you give, the richer you'll be.

## Goals

1. Learn a little about how computers work and how your code _programs_ them.
2. Write some non-trivial programs in Python.
3. Practice writing good code: elegant, efficient, robust, etc.
4. Practice reading & assessing code and offering constructive feedback.
5. Build your problem-solving muscles. We'll focus on a few techniques:
   - decomposing big problems into smaller, more tractable problems
   - using abstractions to manage complexity
6. Improve your ability to communicate technical concepts and decisions to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Put another way, by the end of the course, you should be able to:

- write an interesting program,
- understand how it works, what is good or inventive or craftsmanlike in it, and how it could be improved,
- and explain it and your design decisions to both me and your parents / grandparents / friend who weren't brave or wise or lucky enough to take this course.

## Assignments

I’ll introduce concepts and techniques in class, but the best way to learn how to code is by coding. So we’ll spend most of our time using code to solve interesting problems and build interesting things.

Software developers are notoriously bad at accurately estimating how long projects will take, so I won’t try. We’ll work as fast and build as much as we can. Here’s the kind of work we’ll do:

Portfolio reviews: structured goal-setting, progress tracking, and self-assessment
Projects: coding challenges, exercises, & larger programs you will design, implement, and iteratively improve. You’ll demonstrate what you’ve built, explain how it works, and justify your design decisions. You'll choose projects from a library or follow a curated sequence.  
Final project: an ambitious program you (or you and a group) dream up, build, and show to the world.

## Grading

We’re not all starting with the same knowledge and skill, so there’s no reason to think we’ll all end with the same knowledge and skill. Instead, your grade will be determined by your progress and the progress you help others make.

That may sound easy. It’s not. Self-improvement takes serious effort, discipline, diligence, fortitude, and self-knowledge.

|                              |     |
| ---------------------------- | --- |
| Projects & portfolio reviews | 80% |
| Final project                | 20% |

Final grades will then be assigned in accordance with Northridge’s grading scale.

## Absences, make-up work, and late work

If you are absent, see me before or after class or send me an email. I’ll let you know what you missed and how to make it up.

I’ll accept late work until the last day of the semester, but any past-due assignment will be docked 5 points per day.

## Responsible use of technology

You’re expected to follow the Computer and Network Usage policy described in the student handbook.

During class, you’re also expected to refrain from using the computers or network for anything except what is needed to complete your programming assignments. If you cannot keep your focus on problem sets and projects, it’ll cost you 5 points per distraction.

## A note on generative AI and other code you didn't write

We wouldn’t be able to build very interesting projects if we had to write every line of code ourselves. Indeed, almost all software development depends on code that developers share with each other, often for free.

It’s fairly easy to find or generate code that can satisfy all or part of your assignments. In fact, we’ll spend time learning how to learn from and responsibly use such tools and code we didn’t write. Don’t be afraid, then, to tell us where you got an idea, trick, or technique.

In an essay, you would cite your sources. We’ll sometimes do something similar in our code comments. But I’m most interested in your ability to thoroughly explain the code you submit. If you can’t explain it, it isn’t really yours, at least not in the way that matters most.

## Tools

We will use some free, cloud-based tools to write code this semester.

- [GitHub](https://github.com): used by almost every software developer on Earth, GitHub makes it easy to share code and collaborate. It will also give us access to a browser-based IDE (integrated development environment) where we’ll do most of our coding. GitHub is owned by Microsoft and offers these tools free to students.
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/): a free block-based coding environment built and maintained by MIT. We’ll use Scratch briefly at the beginning of the semester.

You will need an email address to create an account with each service. I’ll send home more details for you and your parents early in the semester.

Developers are always looking for better tools and we, too, may decide we need more or better tools. If so, I’ll give you and your parents plenty of notice.
