Periods 5 (middle school) and 6 (high school)

## Course Description

Students in this project-based course will learn fundamental computer science concepts and computer programming by completing coding challenges and building text-based and 2D games in Python. The course is designed to be approachable and challenging for complete beginners and experienced coders alike.

## Virtues

**Hard work.** Like most things worth doing, learning to code isn't easy. That's no small part of what makes it enjoyable. You'll sweat a little, but you'll be stronger for it. Embrace the challenge.

**Craftsmanship.** Anything worth doing is worth doing well. It's okay to start with hacky or janky code, but let's keep honing our craft, too.

**Adventerousness & daring-do.** Experiment. Tinker. Try new things. Take a few risks. It's the best way to learn and you (probably) won't blow anything up.

**Perseverence.** Code rarely works the first time. Problems can seem intractable. Keep trying. Keep learning. Keep going. You'll get there.

**Resourcefulness.** You will (often) hit walls. Get good at scaling them. Solutions and help are out there if you learn how to ask and where to look.

**Generosity.** We're in this together. Encourage each other and help however you can. The more freely you give, the richer you'll be.

## Goals

1. Learn a little about how computers work and how your code _programs_ them.
2. Write some non-trivial programs in Python.
3. Practice writing good code: elegant, efficient, robust, etc.
4. Practice reading & assessing code and offering constructive feedback.
5. Build your problem-solving muscles. We'll focus on a few techniques:
   - decomposing big problems into smaller, more tractable problems
   - using abstractions to manage complexity
6. Improve your ability to communicate technical concepts and decisions to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Put another way, by the end of the course, you should be able to:

- write an interesting program,
- understand how it works, what is good or inventive or craftsmanlike in it, and how it could be improved,
- and explain it and your design decisions to both me and your parents / grandparents / friend who weren't brave or wise or lucky enough to take this course.
